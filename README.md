A model of non-linear ODEs for simulating calcite dissolution in biological treatment processes at wastewater resource recovery facilities. The file used to run the model is "model_code.m", and the remaining files are functions called by the main code. The model input parameters can be directly modified in the "model_code.m" file. The model can be run to solve for either the time-integrated or the steady-state concentrations of alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved calcium, and calcite within the biological treatment control volume.
