A model of non-linear ODEs for simulating calcite dissolution in wastewater resource recovery facilities. The file used to run the model is "model_code.m", and the remaining files are functions called by the main code. The model can be run to solve for the time-integrated or steady-state concentrations of alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved calcium, and calcite within the control volume.
