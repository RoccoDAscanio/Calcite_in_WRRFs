This repository contains a mathematical model, represented by a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is numerically solved to simulate calcite dissolution in biological treatment processes at wastewater resource recovery facilities. The model simulates the concentrations of alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved calcium, and calcite within the biological treatment control volume, as well as dependent parameters including pH, CO2 partial pressure, and calcite saturation state.

The file used to run the model is "model_code.m", and the remaining files are functions called by the main code. The model input parameters can be directly modified in the "model_code.m" file, within the "input parameters" subsection. The model can be run to solve for either the time-integrated or the steady-state solution by specifying the run flag at the beginning of the "model_code.m" file.
